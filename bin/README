This directory contains some pre-built binaries. Building from scratch
is a pain, because sometimes standard OpenSSL libraries don't export
the 'ssl3_write_bytes()" function needed to create the the Heartbeat
request. Therefore, I have to build OpenSSL, and link this program
to it statically. Since OpenSSL is linked statically to these binaries,
you don't otherwise need OpenSSL installed.

The Windows program is 'bin/win32/heartleach.exe'. It should also
run just fine on 64-bit windows.

The 'bin/kali32/heartleech' binary is designed for the Linux distribution
Kali/1.0.6 in 32-bit mode. It'll probably work on a wide range of other
Linux systems on x86.
