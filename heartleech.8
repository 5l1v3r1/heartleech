.SH "NAME"
\fBheartleech\fR \- Exploits OpenSSL heartbleed vulnerability
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
heartleech \fIhost\fR [\-p\fIport\fR] [\-f\fIfilename\fR] [\-a] heartleech \-F\fIfilename\fR \-c\fIcertficate\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBheartleech\fR exploits the well\-known "heartbleed" bug in OpenSSL\-1\.0\.1f\. It has a number of features that improve over other heartbleed exploits, such as automatically extracting the SSL private\-key (autopwn)\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB<host>\fR: the target\'s name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-p <port>\fR: the port number to connect to on the target machine\. If not specified, the port number 443 will be used\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-f <filename>\fR: the file where bleeding information is stored\. Typically, the user will use this program to grab data from a server, then use other tools to search those files for things, such as cookies, passwords, and private strings\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-a\fR: sets "auto\-pwn" mode, which automatically searches the bleeding buffers for the private\-key\. If the private\-key is found, it will be printed to \fIstdout\fR, and the program will exit\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-F\fR: instead of running live against a server, this option causes the program to run forensics on existing files, looking for private keys\. The option \fB\-c\fR must also be used\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-c\fR: in offline mode, this option tells the program the certificate to load\. A certificate, containing the public\-key, is needed in order to search data for the matching components of a private key\. In online mode, this option isn\'t necessary, because the certificate is fetched from the server duing the SSL handshake\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-d\fR: sets the \'debug\' flag, which causes a lot of debug information to be printed to \fIstderr\fR\. Using this will help diagnose connection problems\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-v <ipver>\fR: sets the version of IP to use, either 4 for IPv4 or 6 for IPv6\. Otherwise, the program tries to guess from the address given, or chooses whichever is first when doing a DNS lookup\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-S\fR: randomizes the size of heartbleed requests\. Normally, the program requests for the max 64k size, but with this setting, each request will have a random size between 200 and 64k\. Some believe that heartbeats of different size will produce different results\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-l <count>\fR: the number of times to loop and try a heartbeat again\. The default count is 1000000 (one\-million)\. A count of 1 grabs just a single heartbeat\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "SIMPLE EXAMPLES"
The following is the easiest way to use the program, to grab the private\-key form the server in \'auto\-pwn\' mode:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ heartleech www\.example\.com \-a
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This auto\-pwn mode will search for the heartbeat payloads looking for the components of the private\-key that matches the server\'s certificate (which it automatically retrieves)\. When a certificate is found, it\'s printed to \fIstdout\fR\. The user can then copy it to a file and use it for anythign that private\-keys can be used for\.
.
.P
Heartbleed information contains more than just private keys\. On a typical web\-server, it\'ll contain session cookies (useful for sidejacking) and passwords\. In that case, the way to use this program is to save all the heartbleed information into a file\. Note that these files quickly grow to gigabytes in size:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ heartleech www\.example\.com \-f bleed\.bin
<ctrl\-c>
$ grep \-iobUaP "Cookie:\.*\en" bleed\.bin
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "IDS EVASION"
Soon after the Heartbleed vulnerability was announced, many people published \'rules\' for Snort\-like intrusion\-detection engines\. These rules all trigger on the pattern |18 03| in the first two bytes of the TCP payloads\.
.
.P
By default, this program avoids putting that pattern in the first two bytes\. Instead, it tries to put those bytes elsewhere in the payload\. Thus, this program should genrally avoid that sort of detection\.
.
.P
Note that this isn\'t complete IDS evasion\. The open\-source Bro program, and many commercial products, do a full SSL protocol decode, and therefore catch this exploit no matter where it is in the packet\. Also, by the time you read this, it\'s probable that the Snort\-like engines will have upgraded their code to support SSL decodes as well\.
